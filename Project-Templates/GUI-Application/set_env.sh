# This is mega irritating! 
# This reads the `.env` file variables and adds them to the `launch.json` file as environment variables. 
# We also use the `.env` file in our Makefiles, which handle them correctly. But VSC can't
# To minimize the risk of errors from  managing two different ways to adjust the variables, we use this script.
#
#   - It use a copy of your original launch.json file name launch.json
#   - in the environment section you need to place the following placeholder and run this script
#        Sample
#       "environment": [
#            { "name": "DISPLAY", "value": ":host.docker.internal:0"},          
#              //PLACEHOLDER_6870

##
# The '.env' file includes a command that instructs the user to run this script

# While the VSC team decided not to support this (discussion 2020) others do. 
# It can be frustrating when tools have limitations like that! Hereâ€™s a summary of systems that support .env files for environment variables:
#
#    Node.js
#    Docker
#    Makefile
#    Python
#    Ruby
#    PHP
#    Go
#    Java
#    Rust
#    DotNet Core
#
# If you ever need to work around the lack of support in Visual Studio Code, you can always use your custom scripts to 
# read the .env file and set the environment variables as needed.
