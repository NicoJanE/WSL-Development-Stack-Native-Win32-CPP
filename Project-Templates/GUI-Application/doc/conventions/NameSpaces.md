### Namespaces  
To enhance code organization and clarity, I follow a structured approach for managing headers and function visibility:

1. Namespace **Usage**: By default all headers are included within a dedicated namespace to group related functionality and prevent naming conflicts.
    
2. Namespace **Aliases**: I create aliases (e.g., namespace WNAPI = WindowNAPI;) for easier access to namespace functions.

 3. **Public Header File**: When needed, a public header is provided outside the namespace to explicitly expose specific functions for external use.

        Function Redirection: In the public header, I define inline functions that redirect calls to the corresponding 
        functions within the namespace. This design allows for a clean and explicit exposure of functionality while keeping 
        the internal implementation details encapsulated. <br><br>

    By implementing this method, we achieve a well-organized codebase that clearly delineates internal and external functionality, improving maintainability and usability for other developers.
